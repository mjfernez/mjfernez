- Hi, I’m @mjfernez

- I’m interested in: digital forensics, memory, operating systems, math, physics, Python, C, and stuff that makes
  life easier
  
- I’m currently learning: C language, gdb, x86 and ARM assembly, the gory details of linux... and git to be honest

- I’m looking to collaborate on security projects, making better documentation (boy does the world neeed that...),
  anything involving a lot of math, cool video game ideas, anything that promotes free (as in freedom!) software
  or a freer world. Or anything in C or Python!
  
- A bit of background: I first learned Visual Basic and Java when I was in high school, but I didn't love those languages
  or the bulky IDEs I was taught on so I never really took code *seriously* until I had a course with MATHLAB in my junior
  year of college. Soon after I found GNU Octave, then Linux, and Python and well.... got hooked from there! Eventually
  got bit by the security bug while I was floundering in a Physics PHD program. Instead of studying stat mech, I was up 
  for hours trying to do hackthissite excercises and reading man pages, so I jumped ship into a cybersecurity program!
  
  I've been working as an Infosec Analyst at Adelphi University since 2019
